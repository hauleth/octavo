//! Implementation of popular (and less popular, but fancy) hashing algorithms.
//!
//! **WARNING**: Not all of them are cryptographic hash functions and there are known attacks on
//! some of them. Use with careful and **always** check that the one you choose fits your
//! requirements!
//!
//! **WARNING**: If you want to use one of this functions as password hash then you are evil human
//! being and I really hope that I'm not using any of your services.
//!
//! ## Cryptographic hash functions
//!
//! Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function):
//!
//! > The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:
//! >
//! > - it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message
//! > - it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash
//! > - it is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash
//! > - it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash.
//!
//! ### Considered safe
//!
//! - `SHA2` family
//! - `SHA3` family
//!
//! ### Deprecated in favour of stronger functions
//!
//! - `SHA1` - deprecated in favour of `SHA2` family
//!
//! ### Broken or easy breakable on modern hardware
//!
//! - `MD4`
//! - `MD5`
